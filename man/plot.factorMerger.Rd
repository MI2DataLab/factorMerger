\usage{
\method{plot}{factorMerger}(factorMerger, panel = "all",
  show = "loglikelihood", nodesSpacing = "equidistant", summary = NULL,
  color = "none", clusterSplit = list(stat = "GIC", value = 2),
  markBestModel = TRUE, markSignificanceStars = TRUE, alpha = 0.05,
  penalty = 2, mergingPalette = NULL, responsePalette = NULL,
  GICcolor = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{panel}{Type of panels to be plot. Possible values are \code{c("all", "response", "GIC", "merging")}.
All types of plots include the Merging Path Plot. Apart from the Merging Path Plot there are
also two possible panels: the Response Plot (response summary, specific to the model family),
the GIC Plot (GIC vs. loglikelihood/p-value).
\itemize{
\item \code{"merging"} plots the Merging Path Plot only,
\item \code{"response"} plots the Merging Path Plot and the Response Plot,
\item \code{"GIC"} plots the Merging Path Plot and the GIC Plot,
\item \code{"all"} plots all panels and a short summary of the full model.
}}

\item{show}{Statistic to be displayed on the OX axis. Possible values are \code{c("loglikelihood", "p-value")}.
If \code{"p-value"} is chosen p-value for the Likelihood Ratio Test against the full model is plot on the OX axis.}

\item{nodesSpacing}{Type of nodes vertical spacing. May be chosen from
 \code{c("equidistant", "effects", "modelSpecific")}. \code{"effects"} arranges nodes according to
 the model coefficients estimatiors (e.g. in Gaussian case on the OY axis group means are plotted).

# TODO: Maybe different names? Implement "modelSpecific".}

\item{summary}{Response panel type -- accepts the following values dependent on the model family:
\itemize{
\item multi dimensional Gaussian: \code{c("heatmap", "profile")},
\item single dimensional Gaussian: \code{c("means", "boxplot")},
\item binomial: \code{c("proportion")},
\item survival: \code{c("survival")}
}}

\item{color}{Specifies how the Merging Path Plot should be colored. Possible values are \code{c("none", "cluster")}.
If \code{color = "cluster"} colors obtained tree according to the \code{clusterSplit}.}

\item{clusterSplit}{List of a length two:
\itemize{
\item \code{stat} - statistic used in the bottom-up search. Available statistics are:
\code{"loglikelihood"}, \code{"pvalue"}, \code{"GIC"}.
\item \code{value} cut threshold / GIC penalty
}
This parameter is considered only with \code{color = "cluster"}.
If \code{stat} is \code{"loglikelihood"} or \code{"pvalue"} performs bottom-up search through models
on the merging path until spots a model scored worse than the given \code{value}. If \code{stat = "GIC"}
treats \code{value} as GIC penalty and returns optimal GIC partition.}

\item{markBestModel}{Boolean. If \code{TRUE}, the default, plots vertical line crossing the optimal model
according to the \code{clusterSplit}.}

\item{markSignificanceStars}{Boolean. If \code{TRUE}, the default, marks models that are significantly
worse than their predecessors on the Merging Path Plot (uses the Likelihood Ratio Test).

Significance codes are:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level. If \code{show = "likelihood"} each interval on
the OX axis of the Merging Path Plot corresponds to the 1 - \code{alpha} quantile of chi-square distribution.}

\item{penalty}{GIC penalty used in the GIC plot. If \code{clusterSplit$stat = "GIC"} it is
recommended to use \code{clusterSplit$value} as \code{penalty}.

TODO: Is it a good idea?}

\item{mergingPalette}{Color palette used in the Merging Path Plot.}

\item{responsePalette}{Color palette used in the Response Plot.}

\item{GICcolor}{Color used in the GIC plot.}
